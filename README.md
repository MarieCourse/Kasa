## Overview

Project Mission during my training at OpenClassrooms.

### The mission

## My process

### Built with

- Javascript
- Create React App
- Sass

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to develop an attractive web interface using Sass for style management, which brought a modern aesthetic to the site. Additionally, I implemented CSS animations to improve the user experience and make the site more interactive. By developing elements of the website interface using React components, I learned how to effectively structure the code and make it modular.

This skill proved to be essential for maintaining the project and adding new features efficiently. Overall, this project allowed me to learn a complete set of front-end development skills, from creating the user interface to implementing complex features, and these skills will be a valuable asset to my future career in the field of web development.

### Useful resources

- [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) - Create React App Official documentation. CRA is an officially supported way to create single-page React applications. It offers a modern build setup with no configuration.
